<p>I&rsquo;m Frank Peng, a 5th year Software Engineering Student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering, Majoring in ICT Engineering and Sub-majoring in Software with a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067-BEngDipProfEngPrac). I am currently an aspiring Cyber Security Consultant and Software Engineer. I hope that my future work contributes to a positive social impact in the field of software and cyber security as we move towards a growing age of technology.</p>

<p>My main motivation for taking the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 - Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset was to explore the possibilities of Cyber Security as a potential future career path for myself when I pursue job opportunities for my senior engineering internship. In addition, I thought that it would be a good introduction to a relevant topic of what I would pursue in my engineering capstone project. I have always had a strong interest in learning Cyber Security but I found that the barriers to entry into actually learning about such a niche field was difficult. Over the past few years, Cyber Security has become more prevalent and I wanted to be a part of such a new and interesting industry, with thoughts about possible future job prospects in mind.</p>

<p>My main objectives that I wanted to achieve by the end of the studio was to be able to develop foundational skills in Cyber Security which would allow me to have the knowledge and skills to pursue further learning afterwards and the potential possibility of gaining a senior internship position in the same or similar field. In addition, I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the potential cyber threats involved and how I might incorporate countermeasures in my software development lifecycle.</p>

<h3 id="learning-contract">Learning Contract</h3>

<p>In the studio subject, I intend to achieve a fundamental cyber security skillset to do web penetration testing, malware/ransomware analysis, cryptography (analysis of encryption/decryption methods), DDos/Dos (Distributed Denial of Service/Denial of Service) attacks and concepts of Active Directory and Remote Desktop Connection that can be exploited.</p>

<p>Later on, I realised I was spreading too thin for time, so I decided to focus on Web Penetration Testing. The reason I decided to narrow my focus down on Web Penetration Testing was due to the fact that it was the skill that would be applicable to a large range of organisations and a good starting point to build upon.</p>

<p>Some of the learning goals that I had set out include:</p>

<ol>
<li>SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection</li>
<li>XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Injection</li>
<li>CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)</li>
<li>Using/Creating Exploits</li>
<li>Phishing Emails/Links</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the tasks that I planned to complete:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bypassing a login screen using SQL Injection.</li>
<li>Use a Stored, Reflected or DOM-based XSS Injection on a website.</li>
<li>CSRF attack for an administrative action (Changing Password/Email/Contact Details or Transferring Funds/Data)</li>
<li>Using/creating exploits on certain systems (Linux or Windows)</li>
<li>Learn how to create an effective phishing email or link.</li>
</ol>

<p>In regards to what I ended up completing, I did learn about SQL Injection, XSS Injection, CSRF, Exploits and Phishing Emails/Links. However, in terms of execution and what I could do in the available subject timeframe I was able to do perform SQL Injection on the login screen, use XSS Injection on a website and use exploits. However, I will carry over my remaining learning goals and tasks as I continue to pursue further learning in the future.</p>

<p>In terms of group projects and teamwork, I was set on contributing equally within the team and if there was a special circumstance that a team member had something urgent or serious going on, I would put in the extra work to get things done.</p>

<p>Consequently, I was fortunate that the studio members were all very reliable and contributed equally to all group-based projects that I participated in. It was well managed and tasks were done on time.</p>

<p>In the process, I have developed a basic skills in Web Penetration Testing and knowledge about common web vulnerabilities that I could exploit to test the security of a website or web app.</p>

<p>Since Cyber Security was more of a skillset and not exactly a product, I was not able to produce a prototype, per se, but I was able to acquire the necessary skills for my learning goal about Web Penetration Testing and Web App Security.</p>

<h3 id="slo-1-engage-with-stakeholders-to-identify-a-problem">SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h3>

<p>During my time in the Cyber Security Studio, I was fortunate enough to meet various cyber security experts and industry stakeholders invited by our Studio facilitators.</p>

<p>Some of these cyber security experts include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Robert Mitchell (Gitlab)</li>
<li>Viren Khatri, Simon Baeg, Nathan Jones (Deloitte)</li>
<li>Ruben Thijssen (Symantec)</li>
</ul>

<p>Robert presented about the evolution of the Cyber Security space and his personal journey through the different eras of the Internet and growth of cyber security threats. His wealth of experience yet humble nature really surprised me and I got to speak to him about the development of the industry and his advice on how I should enter the industry. He presented about the Internet Threats and the various generations of evolution it has undergone.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://utsfpeng.github.io/img/portfolio/SLO1-Robert1.PNG"/> 
</figure>


<p>His recounts on witnessing Generation 1 Viruses like Melissa and ILOVEYOU virus to Generation 4 APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) and Ransomware really gave a very clear overview of how much things have changed with the technology evolution. Furthermore, the lessons he taught us about the mindset and previous lessons from the past being applicable to current and future systems was very eye-opening. It really reinforced the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) Triad that I did not understand from my previous subjects that I learnt at university and it all clicked. It was also very surprising to find out that Human Error was the biggest cause of Cyber Security problems. I always thought that it would be something about the technical aspects that was causing most Cyber Security problems.</p>

<p>Deloitte speakers (Viren, Simon and Nathan) from the Cyber Security Team/ Cyber Intelligence Centre had a more practical-approach presentation in which they gave us a vulnerable machine to hack. It was a very educational lesson that exposed me to a lot of new tools and concepts to go about breaking into a potentially vulnerable system. Their main message about how human error and misconfigurations can cause Cyber Security vulnerabilities to be exposed to individuals with malicious intent who could take advantage and exploit them was very shocking. It made me realise how important it is to monitor and check logs of systems, but also the ease of people breaking into systems that forget to update. They also introduced me to the Metasploit Framework which can be used to find existing exploits for different services and applications. It was really important to note that most of the time it was not necessary to reinvent the wheel, but to use what you have got to break into something. It became a very knowledgeable lesson.</p>

<p>Ruben taught us about Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation. It was also a very hands-on presentation and he even prepared a website for us to get access to the resources he created beforehand. It was a whole new world that I did not know before the lesson. It was so surprising to know that we could use the assembly language to look at possible vulnerabilities. We made use of the tool called Binary Ninja to open binary files and explore the different memory/register addresses and locations. It was a lot greater in difficulty than I initially expected due to the lack of ability to infer the operation of certain functions.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://utsfpeng.github.io/img/rev-eng/morty-2.PNG"/> 
</figure>


<p>Speaking with such a broad variety of external stakeholders has allowed to identify system vulnerabilities in Web Applications such as Heartbleed and the irreversible consequences such as a massive data breach which may cause complex problems including litigations, penalties/fines, loss of brand reputation and customer trust.</p>

<h3 id="slo-2-apply-design-thinking-to-respond-to-a-defined-or-newly-identified-problems">SLO 2 - Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problems</h3>

<p>When attempting to tackle Cyber Security challenges, whether it be Hack The Box Active Machines, OWASP Juice Shop Website or TryHackMe Mr Robot Vulnerable Machine, it is imperative that we think both logically but also outside of the box when the occasion arises. However, as a complete beginner it was hard to know when to stop digging into an endless rabbit hole but move onto a different possible idea. Personally, my innate nature does not like to give up easily, so once I pick up an idea on how to go about solving a specific Cyber Security problem, I would continuously work on it. However, progressing through the Cyber Security studio has challenged my way of thinking and really pushed me out of my comfort zone.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>An active machine on Hack The Box has no write-ups or walkthroughs, so it is purely based on discovery and finding creative ways to solve the problem at hand. Discovery could include things like enumeration (network, file&hellip;etc.), Directory Traversal or experimenting how to use certain tools by trial and error. However, when it comes to problems such as Privilege escalation, Where to launch a reverse shell or how to reach certain directories or acquire certain permissions, it requires a lot of creative thinking on the possible locations that can be used or the different methods of going about it.</p>

<p>During my earlier stages of learning Cyber Security on Natas-wargames by Over The Wire, the challenges really pushed you to be very curious and random about your user input. They would actively encourage you to put special characters to see if you can potentially &ldquo;break&rdquo; the system. This involved me designing a method of cycling through all the special characters and observing the results. Afterwards, I would research different combinations that might produce unexpected results such as a Tilda or a dot as the user input. It could be something as simple as appending various text after special characters to bypass the sanitisation and validation algorithms, so that I can successfully disrupt the program to &ldquo;break&rdquo; and produce unexpected output.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://utsfpeng.github.io/img/natas/natas9-3.PNG"/> 
</figure>


<p>In another scenario, I chose a company website which had a Responsible Disclosure program that allows security researchers and individuals to check for security vulnerabilities under certain guidelines and limitations that would protect you legally from trying to attempt to discover a vulnerability. For example, recently I tried to hack a certain business company&rsquo;s website and after performing the basic steps of discovery, I tried to look at &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; the website with invalid session tokens, invalid cookies, changing the format of cookies to something else, changing the HTTP requests to see if they garner any unexpected favourable responses. I tried finding faults in possibly their forget my password functionality or their sign-in page. After trying different things out to no avail, I tried to sabotage their payment details page/ payment gateway to look for any data leaks or possible attack vectors. Exploring all avenues of where possible attacks can be launched demonstrates the problem solving and design thinking processes involved to exploit well-made business websites.</p>

<h3 id="slo-3-apply-technical-skills-to-develop-model-and-or-evaluate-design">SLO 3 - Apply  technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h3>

<p>As part of Cyber Security Studio, every single time that we have something that we do not know, we would need to research about it. This could be research on a tool, research on possible security vulnerabilities and exploits, system configurations, certain types of output or files among many other things.</p>

            <p>Caption: Researching XSS Injection on OWASP Top 10 for common vulnerabilities and exploits</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Since Cyber Security is never straight forward and every single machine and challenge is something new and fresh, a lot of things will need to be researched. The structure of the system and environment could be similar, but there are a lot of different configurations, services and settings that we do not usually remember because it might only be used once only when we need to due to a specific setup. Hence, there is always a need to research possible security vulnerabilities that might be applicable to a certain setup whether that be a Linux or Windows environment, the version that they are using, the updates/patches that they have installed, configurations and settings adjustments among many others.</p>

</figure>


<p>For example, when I was attempting to gain access to a system using PHP as their main language, I had to research how to get a reverse shell running on the target machine. Hence, I had to look up commands to use on the command line.</p>

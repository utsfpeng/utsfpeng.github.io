<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Frank Peng! I&rsquo;m currently a 5th year Software Engineering Student at UTS. I am undertaking a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Engineering with Honours and a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067v2 - B Eng DipProfEngPrac). I am majoring in ICT Engineering and sub-majoring in Software.</p>

<p>I have always had a strong interest towards Cyber Security since the start of my university degree and I have thought about the possibility of pursuing the Cyber Security field as a potential future career when I graduate. However, I have struggled trying to find a way to start and get involved for a long time, so I haven&rsquo;t had as much exposure to the Cyber Security space as I would&rsquo;ve liked.</p>

<p>I chose to undertake the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 subject and join the Cyber Security Studio as a way to get my hands dirty and begin my journey towards learning about Cyber Security and acquire the skills and experience needed to get me started. I hope to use everything I learn in the studio as a starting point to allow me to continue learning more after building a foundational background in the field.</p>

<h3 id="learning-contract">Learning Contract</h3>

<p>As of right now, some of the learning goals and tasks that I intend to achieve through the project is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Develop Foundational Knowledge in Cyber Security (Common Vulnerabilities, Threats, Bugs. Best practices, tools to use and basic security analysis skills)</p></li>

<li><p>Develop a basic understanding of how to use Python and its applications for the Cyber Security Field.</p></li>

<li><p>Learn how to develop the mindset of Cyber Security professionals starting with Wargames (Bandits, Natas&hellip;etc.).</p></li>

<li><p>Learn how to participate and be involved in CTF (Capture The Flag), so I can learn how to develop myself after the Cyber Security studio.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I intend to be involved as much as possible with the group projects and contribute whatever I can to the team effort and goals that we have together in the studio. I will try and dedicate as much time as I can both within and outside the face to face lessons to give both a fair and just accountability to my team.</p>

<p>Since I am starting the studio from scratch without any actual Cyber Security experience and knowledge, I hope to become a sponge and absorb as much knowledge as I can from all my fellow studio members and team members, so that I can quickly improve myself and be useful to the team. I hope to learn the basic skills required for me to undertake my upcoming senior internship that I wish to pursue in the Cyber Security area. I hope to obtain skills in encryption, decryption, how to detect and look for security vulnerabilities and possible threats, so that I may develop perspectives in both offensive and defensive cyber security.</p>

<p>I hope to produce a prototype by the end of the studio that would demonstrate a security vulnerability or threat. However, it is still subject to change, as I continue the rest of my studio sessions and team interactions.</p>

<h3 id="slo-1-engage-with-stakeholders-to-identify-a-problem">SLO 1 - Engage with Stakeholders to identify a problem</h3>

<p>In our 2nd Studio Session on Wednesday 6th of February 2019, we had a Cyber Security Professional called Robert Mitchell from the Gitlab Security Team to give a presentation on InfoSec (Information Security).</p>

<p>His wealth of knowledge in the Cyber Security field from the very starting emergence of the industry itself was very insightful, especially how he described the various generations involved from Firewalls, to viruses, to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). His journey through the industry inspired me to look differently at how I should approach the industry as a whole and how cyber security can be applied at the most unexpected places and how the ever-changing nature of the industry should be embraced as we pursue a life-long journey of learning when we enter the industry.</p>

<p>His perspective on the criticality of Red-Team and Blue-Team for offensive and defensive security teams trying to both ultimately work towards the same goal of improving cyber security was very unexpected. He also quantified on the impact that certain system vulnerabilities had and the consequences that may result from such issues. He taught us to be very wary and that past lessons learnt can be applied to current and future scenarios, even if it grows in complexity by design.</p>

<h3 id="slo-2-apply-design-thinking-to-respond-to-a-defined-or-newly-identified-problem">SLO 2 - Apply Design Thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h3>

<p>As part of the OWASP Juice Shop challenge, we had to go about finding different security vulnerabilities that were present in the website. We had to take a high-level idea and drill down repeatedly to find potential areas that we can use as leverage to find vulnerabilities on the website. This was one of the first challenges I had for Cyber Security and even though I found it really hard at first, especially in the beginning, but with some guidance and some sheer will in just trying out all my avenues of options, I was able to find certain areas that were susceptible to potential security threats.</p>

<p>Some of the steps that I took to find vulnerabilities include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Checking for basic sql injection issues (a common security vulnerability).</p></li>

<li><p>Find parameters in the source code which are risky and should not be exposed.</p></li>

<li><p>Find incorrect access controls and unexpected behaviours with REST/API Endpoints.</p></li>

<li><p>Find basic social engineering flaws (E.g. Social Media exposure of certain information that may be used for security questions)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="slo-3-apply-technical-skills-to-develop-model-and-or-evaluate-design">SLO 3 - Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</h3>

<p>Starting from our very 1st studio session, we started to research security vulnerabilities with HackerOne - a platform used to identify bugs (security issues) in a software product/service and the actions that cyber security enthusiasts and professionals take to identify and rectify the bugs. We also explored the general nature of bug bounty programs and how they contribute to the growth of the Cyber Security industry and the potential monetary benefits of greater awareness for cyber security and the disadvantages of being ignorant or neglecting to take extra care in cyber security.</p>

<p>Our team presentation focused on how a potential bug that was found could possibly allow anyone to get a lifetime of free games and cause irreparable financial damages to a gaming platform (Steam) and the game developer/s. The bug was found in the most unlikely of places - the developer end of the platform where certain unexpected parameters can be used to gain access to any games on the platform for free. We discovered the potential damage it may cause on the reputation of the organisation and how there is an out-of-the-box mindset being encouraged in the Cyber Security industry.</p>

<h3 id="slo-4-demonstrate-effective-collaboration-and-communication-skills">SLO 4 - Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills.</h3>

<p>In our presentation on bug bounty programs, we had to communicate technical information in easy to digest bite-sized chunks of information to keep the audience engaged, but also informed through simplified perspectives of the situation. We had to tone down unnecessary technical jargon and avoid cluttering our speeches since the whole presentation was limited to 5 minutes long in a group of 5 people. We had to learn how to work together to talk and maintain a flow in our presentation while conforming what we needed to say to our individual 1 minute section. Our information had to be concise, accurate and straight to the point to effectively convey ideas with the least amount of words possible.</p>

<p>We utilised Microsoft Teams to communicate within our team and used the planner add-on as a way to organise our work and be aware across the whole team about which stage we were up to.</p>

<p>We organised our own little group sprint to discuss milestones we achieved on our 2nd day of preparation for the presentation and also what challenges and roadblocks we had ahead before we could finish the presentation.</p>

<h3 id="slo-5-conduct-critical-self-and-peer-review-and-performance-evaluation">SLO 5 - Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</h3>

<p>After our team presentation, Larry (our studio facilitator) gave us very detailed feedback on how we could improve our public speaking skills and the areas that we may need work on.</p>

<p>We also identified my goal of overcoming anxiety and nervous hand shaking motions due to maybe insufficient preparedness and also not being comfortable with too much attention. In addition, we also identified how the community-based environment instead of a classroom-based environment might have played a contributing factor to how I was still able to present despite the nervous breakdown, since the atmosphere was welcoming and friendly instead of a more strict and formal classroom setting.</p>

<p>Discussions with Darsh on how to discover areas of weakness and how to improve them, with regards to Cyber Security was very helpful since it was like a wake-up call on the lack of focus and attention span that I had when I was distracted by noise and other friendly chatter and interactions. However, I tried to find a balance in regards to my study and my friendly interactions with the studio members since I feel that it is important to interact and collaborate with others while getting my tasks completed. In addition, I want to embrace the motto &ldquo;Sharing is caring&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have identified some of the areas that I might need to work on for improvement, such as prioritisation, time management, organisation and structuring my thoughts with my tasks.</p>

      <description>Week 2 - Reflection (Sprint 2) In the Cyber Security Summer Studio this week, our primary focus was on Web Application Security.
Firstly, we started off with a Scrum meeting around the room for each studio member on what we worked on, what we want to work on and our current obstacles. It was very interesting to find some studio members going above and beyond and have acquired such great amounts of experience in such a short period of time. Personally, I was working on Natas and wanted to finish Natas off and move onto the other resources that the studio facilitators (Larry, Darsh, Luke) have provided us with. My current obstacles were mainly technical issues with a bit of a time management issue. However, I hope to improve that moving forward by doing more research and also organising my time better with my schedule on my calendar and prioritisation. (SLO 4 + SLO 5)
We were introduced to some of the most common web application security vulnerabilities that currently exist, which include: CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery), XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and SQLi (Structured Query Language Injection).
CSRF is an attack that forces the user to perform an unwanted action and generally uses state-changing requests since it requires tricking a victim to click on a link or execute an action on behalf of the attacker while the user is authenticated.</description>

      <description>Web Application Security - Problem Statement For submission on Friday 15-02-2019
Current Problem Statement on WebAppSec In Web Application Security, my goal is to learn how to identify common web vulnerabilities and develop a habit/mindset on checking for them first, so that I can do something akin to a process of elimination and work out what flaws and vulnerabilities that a website may have.
Currently, I still feel that I do not have a grasp on what to look for and haven&amp;rsquo;t developed the habit or &amp;ldquo;muscle-memory&amp;rdquo; for discovering common web vulnerabilities. As such, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a logical order of doing the basic steps to eliminate the potential likelihood that common vulnerabilities may exist.
In order to close this knowledge gap, my solution is to start off working on the Natas challenges till I reach the end (if possible) and potentially look at the other resources suggested (WebGoat, Web for Pentester, Shellter Labs and Root Me). In addition, I might try working on Hack The Box and Try Hack Me (Mr Robot), when I feel that I have the basics down and feel comfortable that my skill level can attempt it.
In Natas so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve went through a few levels and discovered a pattern of:</description>

      <description>Natas Journey Natas 0 Natas 0 presented a description stating &amp;ldquo;You can find the password for the next level on this page.&amp;rdquo;
First instinct was to look in the source code for hints.
Found the password written in plain-text within HTML comment tags.
Natas 1 Natas 1 presented a challenge with right-click being blocked. On Google Chrome, I used Developer Tools &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Inspect Element to circumvent the issue and checked the source code.
Found the password written in plain-text within HTML comment tags like the previous level.
Natas 2 Natas 2 stated &amp;ldquo;There is nothing on this page.&amp;rdquo;
Checked Source Code and found a random image source pointing to a path: &amp;ldquo;files/pixel.png&amp;rdquo;.
Checked the pixel.png file and found nothing. So went directory traversing back up into the &amp;ldquo;files&amp;rdquo; directory and it listed the index, which revealed a users.txt file.
natas3 password was written in plain-text.
Natas 3 Just like the previous challenge, Natas 3 stated &amp;ldquo;There is nothing on this page.&amp;rdquo;
Within the Source Code, HTML Comments claim &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;Not even Google will find it this time&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Challenge Accepted!
  Besides finding it directly using Google, if we check &amp;ldquo;robots.txt&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
  It shows that there is a Disallow for a path to &amp;ldquo;/s3cr3t/&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Week 2 - Homework Problem Statement A realistic and achievable goal that I set for myself is to gain fundamentals skills in pen-testing, so that I am able to have a solid skill set that I can build upon after the studio to go towards a future career in cyber security.
Developing the basic mindset of being curious about errors and also how to actually go about testing. E.g. * Checking Source Code * Going through Robots.txt * Checking HTTP GET/POST Requests and their Responses. * Directory traversing * Looking for any access control misconfigurations * XSS injection into all the input fields, especially search bar * SQL injection into login screen input fields.
Currently, I have zero knowledge of Cyber Security in regards to what tools and techniques to use for pen-testing and I want to improve my general ability to detect web application security vulnerabilities.
I have been recommended PicoCTF, HackTheBox, natas and bandits (Wargames) to start myself on the journey of learning.
Also the resources recommended in this week for web penetration skills development include: * Web for Pentester * WebGoat * Natas * Shellter Labs * Root Me

      <description>Week 1 Reflection (Sprint 1) Introduction Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Frank Peng! I&amp;rsquo;m currently a 5th year Software Engineering Student at UTS. I am undertaking a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Engineering with Honours and a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067v2 - B Eng DipProfEngPrac). I am majoring in ICT Engineering and sub-majoring in Software.
I have always had a strong interest towards Cyber Security since the start of my university degree and I have thought about the possibility of pursuing the Cyber Security field as a potential future career when I graduate. However, I have struggled trying to find a way to start and get involved for a long time, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had as much exposure to the Cyber Security space as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked.
I chose to undertake the UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019 subject and join the Cyber Security Studio as a way to get my hands dirty and begin my journey towards learning about Cyber Security and acquire the skills and experience needed to get me started. I hope to use everything I learn in the studio as a starting point to allow me to continue learning more after building a foundational background in the field.

      <description>My very first experience with Markdown I have not had any prior experience with writing markdown, but this is my first attempt at doing so.
It seems to follow a logical structure and have very intuitive and common sense based formatting, so it almost feels like natural language based format when writing. However, there are still a few things that I am trying to confirm, such as code formatting especially when I&amp;rsquo;m writing actual sections or pieces of code on the website.
In addition, I was also advised that I can write pure html as well, it may come especially handy for iframes and also other embedded based html code. Furthermore, I am still getting accustomed to creating tables.
Plans for how I am going to construct this website for UTS MIDAS Summer Studio 2019.
 Home = Home page Blog = Reflections (Weekly Reflections, as part of the requirements for Cyber Security Studio) + SLOs (Addressing all the Subject Learning Outcomes for the studio) Portfolio = End of Studio Deliverable About = Brief Summary about myself and the website.  Going to try and learn python and learn how to use Kali Linux to explore cyber security concepts.</description>
